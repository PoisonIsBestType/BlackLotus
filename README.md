# BlackLotus - color scheme
![](./cover.png)

Dark, dim, blue, purple, beautiful!

BlackLotus is a color theme inspired by Christopher Rush's MTG Black Lotus artwork.

The main colors are reminescent from the lotus flower itself:
- reddish-purplish dark gray tones for background
-  yellowish-greenish dim white tones for foreground
-  dim or bright blue and purple options for accent color


All colors were picked from the artwork directly. With just a few exceptions, to build a cohesive palette.
